# Cryptocurrencies

Prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.<br> The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.<br> The popularity of Bitcoin has caused a price jump.<br> That makes it unaffordable for many new investors.<br> There are many, many more cryptocurrencies available at more affordable prices.<br> Since there is no known output and the data is not ideal, this will be a perfect job for unsupervised machine learning. <br> <br>
